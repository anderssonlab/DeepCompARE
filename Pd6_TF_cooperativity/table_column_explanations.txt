count_redundancy: number of TFBS (pair) that behave in redundant manner
count_synergy: number of TFBS (pair) that behave in synergistic manner
cooperative_distance: median genomic distance (bp) between TF pair
cooperative_distance_iqr: interquartile range between TF pair that behave in cooperative manner
independent_count: number of TFBS (pair) that behave in independent manner
independent_distance: median genomic distance (bp) between TF pair that behave in independent manner
independent_distance_iqr: interquartile range between TF pair that behave in independent manner
i_redundancy: sum of absolute interaction values for all redundant cases
i_synergy: sum of interaction values for all synergistic cases

i_sum = i_redundancy + i_synergy
synergy_score = i_synergy / (i_sum)
cooperative_count = count_redundancy+count_synergy
synergy_fraction = count_synergy / cooperative_count
total_count = cooperative_count + independent_count
independence_score = independent_count / total_count
