# DeepCompARE - Deep Comparative Analysis of Regulatory Elements

DeepCompARE is a lightweight convolutional neural network that simultaneously predicts promoter activity, enhancer potential and chromatin accessibility from DNA sequence. In silico ablation (ISA) is a flexible feature attribution method, which reveals the importance of a base or a motif by masking the corresponding sequence information.
