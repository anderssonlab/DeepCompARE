Significance: A data-dependent model interpretation

Raw_data/: MPRA sequences got from Sarah

Pd1_formatted_sequences/: only extract the sequences

Pd2_DeepCompare_predictions/: DeepCompare predictions, done by Sarah

preprocess.R: Raw_data/ --> Pd1_formatted_sequences/
remove unnecessary columns, then cut sequence information into chunks
